//! `yanshi-config` — shared config schema + config-driven workflow assembly.
//!
//! Holds the YAML workflow [`config`] schema (`FlowDefinitionV2` /
//! `NodeDefinitionV2`) and the [`executor`] that compiles it into an
//! `yanshi-core` `Flow` (`build_flow_from_yaml`). Extracted from
//! `yanshi-cli` in P-A2.4 (RFC §7) so the gateway (`yanshi-server`) can
//! assemble and schedule workflows by depending on this shared crate instead of
//! the CLI binary crate. `yanshi-cli` re-exports both modules under their
//! original `yanshi_cli::{config, executor}` paths.
