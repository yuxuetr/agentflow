# OpenAI Integration Testing for AgentFlow

## Overview
This document describes the OpenAI integration testing setup for AgentFlow nodes, which validates the functionality of all OpenAI models with the AgentFlow framework.

## What's Been Updated

### 1. Model Configurations
- **`/root/agentflow/agentflow-llm/config/models/openai.yml`**: Updated with complete OpenAI model definitions including:
  - GPT-4.1 Series (Latest generation models)
  - GPT-4o Series (Current production models)
  - GPT-4 Legacy models
  - GPT-3.5 models
  - Embedding models (text-embedding-3-large, text-embedding-3-small, ada-002)
  - Audio models (TTS, Whisper)
  - Image models (DALL-E 2 & 3)

- **`~/.agentflow/models.yml`**: Global configuration updated with all OpenAI models alongside existing vendor models

### 2. Test Files Created

#### `examples/openai_models_test.rs`
Comprehensive test suite that:
- Tests all major OpenAI model families
- Validates text generation capabilities
- Tests multimodal vision capabilities (for GPT-4o series)
- Measures response times and performance
- Provides detailed reporting on model availability

### 3. Test Runner Script

#### `test_openai.sh`
Convenience script that:
- Validates OPENAI_API_KEY presence
- Builds the test binary
- Runs comprehensive model tests
- Provides formatted output

## Running the Tests

### Prerequisites
1. Ensure your `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in `~/.agentflow/.env`:
   ```bash
   echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here" >> ~/.agentflow/.env
   ```

2. Make sure you're in the agentflow-nodes directory:
   ```bash
   cd /root/agentflow/agentflow-nodes
   ```

### Run Tests

#### Quick Test
```bash
./test_openai.sh
```

#### Manual Test
```bash
cargo run --example openai_models_test
```

## Test Coverage

The test suite validates:

### Text Generation
- GPT-4.1 series (gpt-4.1, gpt-4.1-mini, gpt-4.1-nano)
- GPT-4o series (gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini, versions)
- GPT-4 legacy (gpt-4, gpt-4-turbo)
- GPT-3.5 series
- Search-enhanced models
- Audio-capable models

### Multimodal Capabilities
- Vision testing for GPT-4o models
- Image understanding validation
- Requires test image at `../assets/AgentFlow-crates.jpeg`

### Performance Metrics
- Response time measurement
- Model availability checking
- API access validation

## Expected Output

The test will produce:
1. Individual model test results with response times
2. Working vs unavailable model summary
3. Performance analysis and fastest model identification
4. Recommendations based on use case
5. System status confirmation

## Model Recommendations

Based on test results, the system will recommend:
- **Premium**: GPT-4.1 for maximum capability
- **Balanced**: GPT-4.1-mini or GPT-4o for cost/performance
- **Fast**: GPT-4.1-nano or GPT-4o-mini for quick responses
- **Multimodal**: GPT-4o series for vision tasks
- **Search**: GPT-4o-search-preview for web-enhanced responses

## Troubleshooting

### No Models Working
- Verify API key is correct
- Check OpenAI account billing status
- Ensure API access is enabled

### Some Models Unavailable
- Preview/beta models may require special access
- Some models need enterprise tier
- Regional restrictions may apply

### Build Errors
- Run `cargo clean` and rebuild
- Ensure all dependencies are updated
- Check Rust toolchain version

## Integration Status

âœ… **READY**: The OpenAI integration is fully configured and ready for use with AgentFlow.

All model configurations have been updated to support the latest OpenAI API offerings, including the newest GPT-4.1 series and specialized models for audio, search, and vision tasks.
