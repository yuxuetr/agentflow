//! Q3.8.5 regression pin: catch silent drift between the documented
//! `agentflow-nodes` feature matrix (CLAUDE.md + `Cargo.toml` doc
//! block) and the actual `nodes/mod.rs` `#[cfg(feature = "…")]`
//! gating.
//!
//! The audit (`docs/audit/agentflow-nodes.md` M7) found that several
//! documented per-modality flags (`asr` / `tts` / `text_to_image` /
//! `image_*`) didn't exist as Cargo features — the modules
//! ship unconditionally. Q4.5 reconciled the docs to reality; this
//! test makes the reconciliation load-bearing so a future PR can't
//! silently re-introduce the drift without an obvious compile/test
//! failure.
//!
//! The test runs under the **default feature set** so `cargo test
//! -p agentflow-nodes` (no `--features` flag) exercises exactly the
//! shape `cargo install agentflow-cli` produces.

// Touch each unconditionally-shipped node module so a future
// `#[cfg(feature = "…")]` added without a matching CLAUDE.md/
// Cargo.toml note breaks this test loudly. Path-existence checks
// are cheaper than instantiating nodes (no `Default` impl assumed)
// and they pin the module-path contract — which is exactly the
// audit invariant we care about.
