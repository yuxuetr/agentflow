//! Capability-backed `Tool` adapters for AgentFlow agent runtimes.
//!
//! # Why this crate exists
//!
//! `agentflow-nodes-ai` already gives DAG workflows vendor-agnostic access
//! to TTS/ASR/image/video generation: each node (`TTSNode`, `AsrNode`, ...)
//! calls `agentflow_llm::AgentFlow::tts(model)`/`text2image_for(model)`/etc.,
//! which resolves the model's vendor from the shared registry YAML
//! (`agentflow-llm/templates/models/*.yml`) and dispatches to that
//! vendor's implementation — all per-vendor request/response reconciliation
//! (StepFun's direct-bytes TTS response vs DashScope's submit-then-fetch-URL
//! two-step protocol, etc.) lives behind that dispatch, invisible to the
//! caller.
//!
//! Agent-native loops (`ReActAgent`), dynamic workflows
//! (`DynamicWorkflowAgent`), and Harness mode don't go through DAG nodes —
//! they call `agentflow_tool::Tool` implementations registered in a
//! `ToolRegistry`. Before this crate, none of the six modalities above were
//! reachable that way at all: the only DAG→Tool bridge (`WorkflowTool` in
//! `agentflow-agents`) wraps an entire `Flow`, not a single capability.
//!
//! Each tool here is a thin wrapper calling the exact same
//! `AgentFlow::*` dispatch function the matching DAG node calls — same
//! model registry, same vendor reconciliation, zero duplicated vendor
//! logic. This crate is deliberately its own adapter crate (mirroring
//! `agentflow-nodes-ai`'s role for DAG nodes) rather than adding
//! `agentflow-llm` as a dependency of the tool-tier `agentflow-tools`
//! crate — that capability dependency was already extracted out of the
//! equivalent tool-tier `agentflow-nodes` crate once before (P-A0.5), into
//! `agentflow-nodes-ai`; this crate follows the same precedent.
//!
//! # Error-handling convention
//!
//! Two distinct failure classes, surfaced two different ways (mirrors
//! `HttpTool`'s convention of only using `Err` for tool-contract-level
//! failures):
//! - **Resolution failure** (bad `model` param, vendor doesn't implement
//!   this modality, missing API key) → `Err(ToolError::InvalidParams)`.
//!   From the caller's perspective this is the same class of mistake as a
//!   malformed parameter — naming a `model` that can't do what was asked —
//!   and actionable the same way: try a different `model`.
//! - **Vendor call failure** (the model resolved fine, but the actual
//!   HTTP call to the vendor failed — network error, rate limit, invalid
//!   voice id, content policy rejection, etc.) → `Ok(ToolOutput::error(...))`.
//!   The tool call itself succeeded as a *tool call*; the underlying
//!   operation just didn't produce a usable result. An agent can inspect
//!   the message and decide whether to retry, adjust parameters, or give up.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use agentflow_tool::ToolRegistry;
//! use agentflow_tools_ai::register_all;
//!
//! let mut registry = ToolRegistry::new();
//! register_all(&mut registry);
//! // `registry` now has "tts", "asr", "text_to_image", "image_to_image",
//! // "image_edit", "image_understand", and "text_to_video" tools, each
//! // driven entirely by the model config YAML — no per-vendor code here.
//! ```
