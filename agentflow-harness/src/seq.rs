//! Monotonic event sequencing — [`Seq`] + [`SeqAllocator`] (P-A3.4).
//!
//! Every [`HarnessEvent`](crate::event::HarnessEvent) carries a `seq`: a
//! per-session monotonic ordinal that lets a sink (JSONL replay, the SSE
//! broker, the Postgres event log) reconstruct the exact order events were
//! produced. The wire field stays a plain `u64` so the frozen beta contract is
//! unchanged; [`Seq`] is the in-process newtype that keeps a raw counter value
//! from being confused with the many other `u64`s in this crate.
//!
//! ## The seq-vs-write race this fixes
//!
//! Before P-A3.4 every emit site did the same three steps independently:
//!
//! ```text
//! let seq = counter.fetch_add(1, SeqCst);   // 1. allocate
//! let event = HarnessEvent { seq, .. };      // 2. build
//! sinks.dispatch(&event).await;              // 3. write (awaits I/O)
//! ```
//!
//! `fetch_add` makes the *numbers* monotonic, but step 3 is an `.await`. When
//! two emitters run concurrently — parallel tool calls through the hook layer,
//! the live `AgentEvent` bridge racing those hooks, or several background tasks
//! — emitter A can win step 1 (`seq = N`) yet lose step 3, so the sink observes
//! `seq = N+1` on the wire *before* `seq = N`. [`SinkChain::dispatch`] does not
//! serialize across callers, so the out-of-order write reaches every sink.
//!
//! [`SeqAllocator::stamp`] closes the window by holding an emit lock across all
//! three steps, so the order events reach the sink is exactly their seq order.
//! The lock is shared by [`Clone`], so every writer that shares one allocator
//! (the runtime, its hook config, its background tasks) is serialized together.
