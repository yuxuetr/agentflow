# AgentFlow Docs

Last updated: 2026-05-09

This directory contains current user and maintainer documentation. Historical
phase reports, old TODO trackers, implementation summaries, and stale backups
have been removed from the active docs tree so this directory stays focused on
working references.

## Start Here

- [CURRENT_STATUS.md](CURRENT_STATUS.md): current authoritative project status,
  implemented surfaces, stability links, and active work.
- [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md): current workspace layout and runtime model.
- [CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md): CLI config, secrets, workflow YAML, and run directories.
- [WORKFLOW_SCHEMA.md](WORKFLOW_SCHEMA.md): implemented config-first workflow validation contract.
- [AGENT_RUNTIME.md](AGENT_RUNTIME.md): agent runtime behavior and event model.
- [SKILLS.md](SKILLS.md): Skill authoring, tools, MCP integration, memory, and CLI commands.
- [MCP_SKILLS.md](MCP_SKILLS.md): MCP tool usage from Skills.
- [TRACING_USAGE.md](TRACING_USAGE.md): trace capture, replay, and inspection.
- [CHECKPOINT_RECOVERY.md](CHECKPOINT_RECOVERY.md): checkpoint and resume behavior.
- [PLUGIN_DESIGN.md](PLUGIN_DESIGN.md): subprocess plugin runtime, manifest,
  workflow node integration, sandbox bridge, and CLI.
- [MARKETPLACE.md](MARKETPLACE.md): remote Skill/Plugin catalog schema,
  artifact cache, signature verification, and marketplace CLI.
- [WEB_UI.md](WEB_UI.md): embedded server UI for run lists, graph status,
  event history, and SSE-backed debugging.

## Project Status And Roadmap

Live at the repository root:

- [`RoadMap.md`](../RoadMap.md): N1–N10 status, including the closed N8/N9
  foundations and the N10 plugin, distributed, Web UI, and marketplace base.
- [`TODOs.md`](../TODOs.md): active task queue derived from the evaluation and roadmap.

Archived under `docs/archive/`:

- [`PROJECT_EVALUATION_2026-05-19.md`](archive/PROJECT_EVALUATION_2026-05-19.md):
  **most recent evaluation** (HEAD `daaa912`, A overall) — v1.0.0-rc.1 candidate;
  all N1–N10 segments closed.
- [`PROJECT_EVALUATION_2026-05-14.md`](archive/PROJECT_EVALUATION_2026-05-14.md):
  follow-up evaluation that drove the P6/P7/P-H/M segment additions.
- [`PROJECT_EVALUATION_2026-05-01.md`](archive/PROJECT_EVALUATION_2026-05-01.md):
  historical module-by-module evaluation (HEAD `41ed3f8`, B+ overall).
- [`TODOs-archive-2026-05-09-n1-n10.md`](archive/TODOs-archive-2026-05-09-n1-n10.md)
  and [`TODOs-archive-2026-05-10-p0-p4.md`](archive/TODOs-archive-2026-05-10-p0-p4.md):
  completed execution-plan history.
- [`TODOs-archive-2026-05-19-recently-closed.md`](archive/TODOs-archive-2026-05-19-recently-closed.md):
  Recently-Closed entries swept out of the active `TODOs.md` on 2026-05-19.

## Historical Release References

These remain as release/migration references, not as current design documents:

- [RELEASE_NOTES_v0.2.0.md](RELEASE_NOTES_v0.2.0.md)
- [MIGRATION_GUIDE_v0.2.0.md](MIGRATION_GUIDE_v0.2.0.md)

## Maintenance Rule

Keep active docs tied to implemented behavior. Put time-boxed plans, phase
completion notes, audit reports, and TODO trackers outside `docs/` or delete them
after their decisions have been folded into stable guides.
