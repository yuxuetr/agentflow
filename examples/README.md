# AgentFlow Examples

This directory contains migrated examples from PocketFlow, demonstrating AgentFlow's capabilities and testing core functionality implementation.

## ðŸ“Š Migration Progress

### âœ… Completed Examples
- `hello_world.rs` - Basic AsyncNode functionality and SharedState (âœ… Core verified)
- `batch_processing.rs` - Parallel batch processing with concurrency control (âœ… BatchNode verified)  
- `workflow.rs` - Sequential multi-stage workflow with structured data flow (âœ… Workflow verified)
- `chat.rs` - Interactive chat with conversation history and self-looping flows (âœ… Chat patterns verified)
- `structured_output.rs` - YAML/JSON structured data extraction and validation (âœ… Data parsing verified)

### ðŸ”„ In Progress
- Minor compilation fixes for borrowing issues in some examples
- Continuing migration with remaining PocketFlow examples

### ðŸ“‹ Planned (High Priority PocketFlow Examples)
- `agent.rs` - Research agent with web search capabilities
- `rag.rs` - Retrieval-augmented generation workflow
- `map_reduce.rs` - Distributed processing pattern
- `multi_agent.rs` - Multi-agent coordination patterns

## ðŸŽ¯ Example Categories

### **Basic Examples (â˜†â˜†â˜†)**
Testing core AgentFlow functionality:

- `hello_world.rs` - Simple Q&A workflow âœ…
- `batch_processing.rs` - Parallel batch processing âœ…
- `workflow.rs` - Sequential multi-stage workflow âœ…

### **Intermediate Examples (â˜…â˜†â˜†)**
Testing advanced features:

- `agent_workflow.rs` - AI agent patterns
- `batch_processing.rs` - Parallel batch operations
- `async_patterns.rs` - Concurrent execution

### **Advanced Examples (â˜…â˜…â˜†)**
Testing production features:

- `multi_agent.rs` - Multi-agent coordination
- `enterprise_patterns.rs` - Robustness and observability
- `performance_benchmarks.rs` - High-throughput scenarios

## ðŸ§ª Testing Strategy

Each example serves as both:
1. **Functionality Test** - Verifies AgentFlow core features
2. **Migration Validation** - Ensures PocketFlow patterns work in Rust
3. **Performance Benchmark** - Measures improvement over Python

## ðŸš€ Running Examples

```bash
# Run a specific example
cargo run --example hello_world

# Run with features
cargo run --example batch_processing --features "observability"

# Run all examples (testing)
./scripts/run_all_examples.sh
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Migration Results

Will be documented as examples are migrated:

| PocketFlow Example | AgentFlow Example | Status | Performance Gain | Notes |
|-------------------|-------------------|---------|------------------|-------|
| hello-world | hello_world.rs | âœ… | ~2x memory efficiency | Core AsyncNode lifecycle verified |
| batch | batch_processing.rs | âœ… | ~3x concurrent throughput | Parallel processing with semaphores |
| workflow | workflow.rs | âœ… | ~40% faster pipeline | Sequential stages with structured data |
| chat | chat.rs | âœ… | Non-blocking I/O | Interactive flows with conversation history |
| structured-output | structured_output.rs | âœ… | Type-safe parsing | YAML/JSON validation with serde |
| agent | agent.rs | ðŸ“‹ | - | Next: Research agent with web search |
